## 🔎 How it works?
> Aiming to facilitate and propose the monitoring of machines within an industry, the project works from an MQ-2 gas sensor (which will be represented by a potentiometer) that will send the collected data to a database in real time through Wi-Fi.
> Thus, when unusual data is detected, the machine can be turned off via a bluetooth connection between the ESP, a smartphone and the machine (which will be represented by the LED).
